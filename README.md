# MERN STACK AUTHENTICATION USING JSON WEB TOKEN AND PROTECTED HOME ROUTE 


This project is used for authentication in mern website using jsonwebtoken(jwt).

The authentication flow is as follows :

After login to the website , a unique token is generated and it is stored in local storage .

and using this token in local storage home route is protected.

I have also added a storage event listener so that while using the website is user clears the local storage anyhow 
then they has to login again
